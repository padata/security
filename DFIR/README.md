# Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) Playbook

This playbook outlines a structured approach to implementing a Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) framework in AWS, focusing on automated playbooks and forensic workflows for cloud and hybrid environments. It includes key features such as automated incident response (IR) playbooks, cloud forensic toolkits, breach containment workflows, and regulatory-ready evidence collection to reduce recovery time while ensuring audit-ready investigations.

## Features
- **Automated IR Playbooks**: Predefined workflows for common attack scenarios.
- **Cloud Forensic Toolkits**: Support for AWS and Azure environments.
- **Breach Containment Workflows**: Rapid isolation and mitigation processes.
- **Regulatory-Ready Evidence Collection**: Ensures compliance with audit requirements.
- **Reduced Recovery Time**: Streamlined processes for faster incident resolution.

## Project Phases and Tasks

### 1. Project Initiation
**Objective**: Establish the foundation for the DFIR framework.

- **Define Project Scope**: Outline objectives, deliverables, and success criteria for the DFIR implementation.
- **Define Asset Scope**: Identify assets to be monitored, including EC2, Lambda, EKS, Fargate, and other relevant AWS services.

### 2. Planning & Requirements
**Objective**: Develop a comprehensive plan and gather requirements.

- **Prepare and Review Solution Architecture**: Design the DFIR architecture, ensuring integration with AWS services and alignment with Zero Trust principles.
- **Identify Accounts to Monitor**: Determine which AWS accounts require forensic oversight (e.g., production, development, security).
- **Draft Incident Response Playbooks**: Create initial playbooks for common attack scenarios (e.g., unauthorized access, data exfiltration).
- **Forensic AMI Preparation & ARB Approval**:
  - Identify required forensic tools (e.g., Volatility, AWS CLI, forensic utilities).
  - Build a custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with pre-installed forensic tools.
  - Document installed tools and system configurations for transparency.
  - Submit AMI and toolset for Architecture Review Board (ARB) approval.
  - Address ARB feedback and finalize the AMI.

### 3. Environment Setup
**Objective**: Configure the AWS environment for forensic readiness.

- **Create Forensic AWS Account and Configure Organizations**: Set up a dedicated forensic account with AWS Organizations for isolation.
- **Set Up Infrastructure**:
  - Create S3 buckets for evidence storage.
  - Configure KMS keys for encryption.
  - Establish IAM baseline with least-privilege policies.
- **Enable Logging Services**:
  - Activate CloudTrail for audit trails.
  - Enable AWS Config for compliance tracking.
  - Configure VPC Flow Logs for network activity monitoring.

### 4. Solution Deployment in Forensic Account
**Objective**: Deploy the forensic infrastructure.

- **Build and Review CloudFormation Stack**: Create a CloudFormation stack for forensic tools and configurations.
- **Set AWS Credentials for Deployment**: Ensure secure credential management for deployment.
- **Deploy Forensic Stack**: Launch the stack to provision forensic resources.

### 5. Security Account Deployment
**Objective**: Establish a centralized security account for monitoring and coordination.

- **Define Account Purpose**:
  - Security Detection Aggregator: Centralize threat detection.
  - Log Aggregator: Consolidate logs for analysis.
  - Trigger Forensic Workflow: Automate forensic actions.
  - Remediation Coordinator: Manage incident response actions.
  - Audit and Compliance Dashboard: Provide visibility into compliance status.
- **Identify Tools for Deployment**: Utilize AWS Security Hub, GuardDuty, Macie, and Config for comprehensive security monitoring.
- **Build and Review CloudFormation Stack**: Develop a stack for security account resources.
- **Deploy Stack**: Launch the security account infrastructure.

### 6. Application Account Deployment
**Objective**: Enable forensic capabilities in application accounts.

- **Enable and Validate SSM Agents**: Ensure Systems Manager (SSM) agents are installed and operational on EC2 instances.
- **Define IAM Role**: Create roles with least-privilege access for forensic operations.
- **Define Network Access for SSM Endpoints**: Configure VPC endpoints for secure SSM communication.

### 7. Testing & Simulation
**Objective**: Validate the DFIR framework through simulations.

- **Simulate Incidents with Test Tags**: Trigger mock incidents to test response workflows.
- **Validate Snapshot/Memory Dump**: Use custom AMI tools to capture and analyze snapshots and memory dumps.
- **Review CloudWatch Logs and Results**: Analyze logs to verify incident detection and response.
- **Confirm Workflows per IR Playbook**: Ensure playbooks execute as expected.

### 8. Documentation & Training
**Objective**: Finalize documentation and train teams.

- **Finalize Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Incident Playbooks**: Document all processes and workflows.
- **Train IR and SOC Teams**: Conduct training on new workflows, tools, and playbooks.

### 9. Go Live & Continuous Monitoring
**Objective**: Activate the DFIR framework and maintain ongoing vigilance.

- **Activate Monitoring**: Enable real-time monitoring with Security Hub, GuardDuty, and CloudWatch.
- **Schedule Incident Simulations**: Regularly test the system with simulated incidents.
- **Update Playbooks/AMI/Tools as Needed**: Continuously improve based on new threats and feedback.

## Implementation Notes
- **Automation**: Leverage AWS EventBridge and Lambda for automated remediation and forensic workflows.
- **Compliance**: Ensure all evidence collection adheres to regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- **Integration**: Align with existing AWS security services (e.g., Security Hub, GuardDuty) for a cohesive framework.
- **Scalability**: Design the architecture to scale across multiple accounts and regions.

This playbook provides a structured, automated, and scalable approach to DFIR in AWS, ensuring rapid response and regulatory compliance.
