# AWS Zero Trust Security Framework

This document outlines a conceptual framework for implementing a Zero Trust security model within an AWS environment. It is based on the principle of "never trust, always verify," and is broken down into seven key areas, each with a core principle and a list of relevant AWS services and patterns.

## 1. Identity & Access Control
**Principle**: Always authenticate and authorize explicitly.

**AWS Services / Patterns**:
- IAM Identity Center with federation (Okta, Azure AD, etc.).
- MFA Everywhere (console, CLI, API).
- Least Privilege IAM Policies (role-based or ABAC).
- Service Control Policies (SCPs) to block unsafe actions (root account, public S3, unapproved regions).

## 2. Device & Endpoint Security
**Principle**: Validate endpoint/device posture before granting access.

**AWS Services / Patterns**:
- Amazon WorkSpaces / AppStream for controlled access to AWS workloads.
- Systems Manager (SSM) for patch compliance and enforcing security baselines.
- Amazon Inspector for vulnerability scanning of EC2/ECR.
- PrivateLink or Client VPN instead of direct public access.

## 3. Network Security
**Principle**: Network location is not enough; enforce segmentation and encryption.

**AWS Services / Patterns**:
- VPC Segmentation with isolated subnets per workload.
- AWS Network Firewall + Security Groups + NACLs.
- Service-to-service mTLS (App Mesh / ACM Private CA).
- PrivateLink to keep traffic off the public internet.
- Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall to block malicious domains.

## 4. Workload Security
**Principle**: Secure workloads, verify runtime behavior, and enforce policies.

**AWS Services / Patterns**:
- EKS / ECS with IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) for least-privilege pods.
- AWS WAF & Shield for app-layer protection.
- CodePipeline + CodeBuild with security checks (linting, vulnerability scans).
- Runtime monitoring with CloudWatch Logs/Container Insights.

## 5. Data Security
**Principle**: Encrypt all data, enforce least-privilege access, and monitor usage.

**AWS Services / Patterns**:
- KMS + customer-managed CMKs for encryption (S3, RDS, DynamoDB, EBS).
- S3 Block Public Access & Bucket Policies to restrict access.
- Macie for sensitive data discovery (PII, PHI).
- Lake Formation / Glue Data Catalog for fine-grained data lake access.
- DLP at edge via CloudFront + WAF integration.

## 6. Monitoring & Continuous Verification
**Principle**: Continuously evaluate security posture; assume compromise.

**AWS Services / Patterns**:
- GuardDuty for anomaly detection.
- CloudTrail + Config for audit trails & compliance.
- Security Hub to centralize findings across accounts.
- Detective for incident investigation.
- Automated remediations with EventBridge + Lambda.

## 7. Automation & Governance
**Principle**: Enforce Zero Trust with automation and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

**AWS Services / Patterns**:
- AWS Control Tower for a secure landing zone.
- CloudFormation / Terraform for consistent infrastructure baselines.
- Config Rules to auto-remediate policy drift (e.g., deny unencrypted volumes).
- CI/CD + GitHub Actions for security testing before deployment.
